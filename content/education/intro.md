DP curates and supports the Master in Games at ITU University of Copenhagen.


Our MSc in Games is taught by the researchers at the Cnter for Digital Play together with experienced part-time teachers from the Danish games industry. Our program in game design and development is divided into two tracks - Game Design and Game technology - and allows students to build their specialisations based on a wide range of mandatory and elective courses. The students will gain a solid foundation of creative, technical, social, and analytical competences. By understanding the complex creative process of game production, and how professional development teams work together, the students engage in team projects of different sizes and go through the full development cycle of a game product.

The MSc in Games is as much about making as it is about understanding. It provides the students with practical and theoretical knowledge on how digital play experiences are made, how they create meaning, and how they impact our social interactions and communities. We explore cutting edge technologies for their playful potential, and our students become experts in realizing creative projects in interdisciplinary teams. Students learn how to use design methods, technical experimentation, analytical tools, critical thinking, and scientific research to drive innovation.

The graduates from our MSc in Games find employment in across the Danish game industry and well beyond. Equipped with a critical and contextual understanding, they build the next generation of games for the multitude of players out there.
