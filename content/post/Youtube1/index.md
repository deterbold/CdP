Why do we study games? What is the field of 'game studies'? How does research into games help us better understand the changing nature of games in times of chaos, such as the global pandemic?

In this roundtable discussion, we try to answer these questions and more from a variety of angles. Enjoy a wide-ranging discussion on what game studies is, what it can offer us, and how it has helped us to better understand the role of games in society.
