We discuss whether this is (or should be) the last generation of consoles, what the meaning and role of difficulty and adaptive difficulty is in games, and why Soma (Frictional Games, 2015) is such an intriguing game from a philosophy of mind perspective. Hosted by Dom Ford, who is joined by Paweł Grabarczyk and Miguel González Duque. This is the pilot episode for ITU Playcast, a podcast by the Center for Computer Games Research at the IT University of Copenhagen. Each episode, a few of us get together to discuss both popular topics in the world of games, as well as what we're working on in our research.
