When is a bunch of pixels an object rather than a picture of an object? Can I unpack these digital objects into a series of homes and apartments? Find out now, as we discuss Jesper Juul's latest playable essay on videogame objects, and Witch Beam's charming new game Unpacking. Hosted by Dom Ford and Pawe≈Ç Grabarczyk. This is the third episode of ITU Playcast, a podcast by the Center for Computer Games Research at the IT University of Copenhagen. Returning after a little while, we're trying out a simple format: each episode, we have a chat about one academic paper and one game.
