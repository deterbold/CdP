We discuss creepypastas in, about and as games, and what empathy means, how it relates to and works within games, and why it's important to think about. Hosted by Dom Ford, who is joined by Nina Patricia Houe and Miruna Vozaru. This is the second episode of ITU Playcast, a podcast by the Center for Computer Games Research at the IT University of Copenhagen.
Each episode, a few of us get together to discuss both popular topics in the world of games, as well as what we're working on in our research.
