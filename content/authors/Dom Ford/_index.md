I'm a PhD Fellow at the IT University of Copenhagen studying myth and cultural meaning in digital games. I also hold a BA and an MA in English from the University of Exeter, focusing largely on digital games and late medieval Arthurian romance, and I bring that literary and cultural analysis to digital games. In 2019, I completed an MSc in Games at the IT University of Copenhagen.

I'm particularly interested in myth, monsters, spatiality and the representation and depiction of history and the past (both real and fictional histories) in digital games.
