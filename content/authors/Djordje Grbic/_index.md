I finished a computer science master's degree at the University of Zagreb where I worked on the application of AI to the university exam scheduling for my master thesis. After the master's, I moved to Switzerland to complete my Ph.D. in the application of AI to evolutionary biology. Currently, I am doing my postdoc at the IT University of Copenhagen where I'm on an international DARPA project concerning self-driving vehicle safety. At the ITU I was in charge of two courses on the master's program.
