As a PhD Fellow at the IT University of Copenhagen I am currently conducting ethnographic research in which the single-player play-practise is investigated from a perspective of learning and identity development. 
I have a somewhat varied background ranging from physical therapy, pedagogical management and teaching, and most recently a MSc degree within Games Studies. I believe this may offer an unusual point of entry into the understanding of players and their play practises, as I work primarily in a holistic view with the sociocultural frame of play and digital games as a part of players’ understanding and experiencing themselves and their life-worlds through learning processes and learning experiences.
