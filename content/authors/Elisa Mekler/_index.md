I research motivational and emotional aspects of the User Experience and Games to establish a better understanding of "good" Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI). I'm also interested in how we do research and construe knowledge in HCI.

I was recently awarded an ERC StG (2022 - 2027) to investigate the use of psychological theories in game design and production practice, and develop methods for how HCI can more productively translate theories from other disciplines into actionable knowledge for research and practice.
