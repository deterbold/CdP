bio: I study how a cultural and social context influences both what people design and how they play. Being educated in Media and Cultural Studies, I find it exciting to explore how play fits into our everyday lives and what part gender plays in this. The topic I have studied the most is game fandom and fans' participation in game development. Through my future research I wish to understand the differences and similarities between human play and animal play. This is something that two Bornean orangutans in Indonesia helped me to start exploring already in 2011. Alongside my own research, I find it important to support the community of games researchers and have been a member of the DiGRA Executive Board for more than 10 years currently serving as the President of DiGRA. I also make games with serious topics as part of research projects and in other small productions.
