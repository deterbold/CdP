# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: y research interest lies at the intersection of human-computer interaction, interaction/game design, and artificial intelligence (AI).

I have co-authored more than 100 peer-reviewed research publications and received several Best Paper Awards. My research has been funded by National Science Foundation, National Institute of Health, and Novo Nordic Foundations. I am a Co-Editor of the Software Studies Book Series at MIT Press and a Board Member of Society for the Advancement of the Science of Digital Games (SASDG).
