Current research interests: Rune's primary research interest is the concept of computer game addiction and its ontology, phenomenology, and etiology. Rune co-authored the handbook "Det modstr√¶bende Panoptikon" (The Reluctant Panopticon), which deals with the unique challenges of psychological and pedagogical praxis in Danish juvenile detention facilities.
