summary: If you liked that, you will love this - A talk by Susana Tosca, Professor of Media Studies at the University of Southern Denmark
abstract: We have all been there - watching an episode of our favorite crime serial for the umpteenth time, mindlessly singing along to the eternal loop of 80s music which Spotify keeps suggesting to us, or even wondering if the world needs yet another Les Misérables adaptation. The same content gets repeated in endless reinterpretations, rehashes, reboots, sequels, prequels…, in a cycle of perhaps eternal returns. Contemporary media like Tiktok seem to be particularly geared towards repetition and reminiscence, as more and more of the same kind of content is pushed to us by profiling algorithms in such excess that we might begin to wonder if we´ll ever see or hear anything original again. This talk will engage with the concept of repetition and show how it can reveal unexpected connections in relation to perception, cognition, enunciation, production, reception and even automation in relation to contemporary media practices.
