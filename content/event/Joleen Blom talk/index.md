summary: Video Game Characters and Transmedia Storytelling - A talk by Joleen Blom
abstract: In the presentation, Joleen Blom will talk about her book publication Video Game Characters and Transmedia Storytelling, published at the Amsterdam University Press at the end of October 2023. The book discusses the video game characters embedded in our contemporary popular culture in which they are constantly produced and re-imagined. The first half of the talk will focus on the writing and publication process. It will address questions such as what was it like to publish an academic book for the first time? What is it like to work on a book publication instead of a PhD dissertation? What were the challenges and what went well? What would I do different in the future? The second half will engage with the contents of the book. The talk will particularly focus on transmedia character studies and the role of digital games in our contemporary media ecology so focused on continuity between stories and characters.
