summary: Backing the Right Horse. Unpacking and perspectivizing political tools for game industry growth - A talk by Helena Sokol
abstract: The Danish game industry is, in the light of recent increased political awareness, moving towards new and interesting positions, both culturally and economically. Whether it is the decision to establish a separate Danish Game Development Institute, or research solidifying the strong consumer relationship with games in Denmark, we are currently seeing a variety of political initiatives take form. This is mirrored on a Nordic and European level, where the video game industry is being both scrutinized and explored to protect the consumers and improve the products. However, it is not always transparent how political systems function, and with good reason - they are extremely complex. This talk aims to highlight some of the tools and initiatives that are often used, the implications and challenges that these have, and what we might see in the future.
